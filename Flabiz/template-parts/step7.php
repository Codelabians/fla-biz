                    An S Corporation is a corporation which has elected a special tax status. This tax treatment permits the income of the corporation to be "passed through" to the shareholders. Thus, shareholders report the income or loss which is generated by an S Corporation on their individual tax returns. In order to be considered an S Corporation, the stockholders of a properly filed corporation must elect such status within 75 days of formation for the current tax year, or at any time during the preceding tax year. This election is made by filing Form 2553 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We offer this as an option for only $39.
